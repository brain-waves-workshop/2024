    <div id="overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Nearly 100 years after the first electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, brain wave analysis remains a central focus in psychology and neuroscience research and is widely used in clinical diagnostics and rehabilitation. Recent advances suggest that beyond their role in specific functions, brain waves might orchestrate communication and interactions across brain regions, potentially supporting efficient neural computations. However, identifying specific relationships between oscillatory brain features and cognitive or clinical phenomena is challenging, given the large heterogeneity in the population and methodological differences in the field.</p>
        <p>Within the context of a collaboration between <b>the Psychophysics and Neural Dynamics Lab</b> (UNIL) and <b>the Neuromove-rehab Lab (UNIPD)</b>, “Rhythms of the Brain: Integrating Knowledge from Perception and Sensory-Motor Research”, we are hosting a symposium with four leading researchers to address state-of-the-art methodological and theoretical issues in the study of brain waves:</p>

        <h2>Speakers</h2>
        <div class="speaker">
            <img src="images/alamia.jpg" alt="Andrea Alamia" class="speaker-photo">
            <h3>Andrea Alamia (CerCo, CNRS)</h3>
            <p style="text-align:left">Andrea will present a predictive coding model of alpha rhythms (8-13 Hz), showing how predictive mechanisms in the visual cortex may generate alpha-band traveling waves, and how these mechanisms might differ in psychedelic states and schizophrenia.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="speaker">
            <img src="images/gordillo.jpg" alt="Dario Gordillo" class="speaker-photo">
            <h3>Dario Gordillo (Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin)</h3>
            <p style="text-align:left">Dario will assess EEG features as potential endophenotypes in schizophrenia. His study of a large cohort of patients and controls reveals surprisingly low correlations among EEG features, even among those typically associated with the disorder. This suggests that different EEG features may capture distinct and highly heterogeneous aspects of the disease rather than a unified characteristic.</p>

        <div class="speaker">
            <img src="images/pagnotta.jpg" alt="Mattia F. Pagnotta" class="speaker-photo">
            <h3>Mattia F. Pagnotta (UC Berkeley)</h3>
            <p style="text-align:left">Mattia will investigate the role of alpha oscillations in working memory (WM), particularly within the frontal-parietal network. His neuroimaging and TMS studies demonstrate the dual function of alpha activity in suppressing irrelevant information and maintaining WM through phase-coding mechanisms.</p>

        <div class="speaker">
            <img src="images/seeber.jpg" alt="Martin Seeber" class="speaker-photo">
            <h3>Martin Seeber (UCLA)</h3>
            <p style="text-align:left">Martin will present his results on theta (4-8 Hz) dynamics during real and imagined navigation using intracranial EEG in freely moving individuals. His results suggest that theta oscillations encode spatial and temporal transitions, with EEG source imaging revealing functional connectivity between the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex.</p>
